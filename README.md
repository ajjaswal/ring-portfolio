# Ring-Portfolio

## Description
   I used different HTML and CSS elements to make a professional portfolio detailing the work I've done so far. I have a heading with my name and avatar under it. The nav bar directs you to different parts of my page. The "work" section includes my first project (which is bigger than the others), it is clickable and directs you to that page. I have placeholders for the others. I have a working contact section. The page can be viewed on different devices and screen resolutions.
